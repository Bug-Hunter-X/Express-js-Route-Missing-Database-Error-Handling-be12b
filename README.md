# Express.js Route Missing Database Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: neglecting error handling for database operations. The provided code snippet fetches user details from a database; however, it only handles the case where the user is not found.  It lacks proper error handling for database connection errors, query execution errors, etc., which can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes.

The solution demonstrates how to implement robust error handling using try...catch blocks and sending appropriate HTTP error responses.
